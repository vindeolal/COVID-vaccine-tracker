# COVID-vaccine-tracker 

## Right now only checks for the first dose availability in the entered pin.

Enter age group(45 or 18) and 6 digit pin. It'll refresh the status every 5 second and as soon as any slot is available it starts shouting in duck's voice :smile:. 

Although code is hosted at https://vindeolal.github.io/COVID-vaccine-tracker/ but because of the rate limit of 100 API calls per 5 minutes per IP it is recomended to download the html file and run it from your browser.

Download the html file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vindeolal/COVID-vaccine-tracker/main/index.html) (right click -> save file) and then open it in the browser. Enter the `age group` and `pin` and let the browser run in background. It'll alarm you once slot is available in your pin.
